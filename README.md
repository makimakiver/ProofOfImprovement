# Project Overview:
the biggest issue in the prediction market is that the target of the prediction market is not getting rewarded. For example, Although cristiano ronaldo did hattrick in a football match, money generated from the prediction market will not flow into cristiano ronaldo's wallet. As the prediction market will get niche more and more, there must be a prediction market which is satisfying following criterias:
1: users can easily be listed with some privacy protection. 
2: users can get rewarded by performing well on the occasion. 

We have achieved them via adding logics to the smart contracts and enable the market creators to get rewarded by performing more than average score.
